            <div class="cuadro1_h4">
                <h4>Visual Hierarchy</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
                <p class="">Slack</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
                <a href="https://slack.com/intl/es-pe">slack.com</a>
            </div>
            
            <img src="./imagesL2/slack.jpeg" alt="slack-webpage">
            <p class="p1">As we can see in the slack(spanish) page the first impression is a phrase. That phrase say us that they are 
                the best plataform for work with your team. Althought that page have many content, for them the most important thing is 
                tell you that they are the best plataform for working with your team and how can you do it. That is because i choose 
                that page as an examplem of Visual Hierarchy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cuadro2">
            <div class="cuadro1_h4">
                <h4>Hick's Law</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
               <p>Ishop</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
                <a href="https://tiendasishop.com/pe/">tiendasishop.com</a>
            </div>
            
            <img src="./imagesL2/ishop.jpeg" alt="ishop-webpage">
            <p class="p2">In Ishop(spanish) page we have a lot of information to discover. There are hundreds of options. Find specifically something that you want for example a case por airpods you can 
                go to the menun and put your mouse in audio and it shows you oyher menu with the options but they have pictures that 
                make you easy find that you want. Other thing is that when you go to case's page you just find cases. In other pages 
                you are in the case's page and they shows you other thingd like speakers or phones. That is because i choose Ishop for 
                Hick's Law model.</p>

        <div class="cuadro3">
            <div class="cuadro1_h4">
                <h4>Fitt's Law</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
                <p>Spotify</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cuadro1_p">
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">spotify.com</a>
            </div>
            <img src="./imagesL2/spotify.jpeg" alt="spotify-wenpage">
            <p class="p3">In spotify page there is something interesting. Also we have many information to navigate but they have 
                created a way in wich you have all the options in just the first page. You will not waste time searching the 
                information that you want navigating in menus and many submenus. Yo have almost all wat you want in the home page 
                and if you want find something yo will do it fast. For that reason I chose spotify as an example of Fitt's Law.</p>
